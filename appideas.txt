Concept Ideas:
--------------

NAME: 

+=Game Concept:

- Must look simplistic
- Must be harder with time
- Ads
- 3D Platformer

NAME: Black Hole

IDEA:
- Similar to Temple Run
- One Course, Different platforms
- Tilt: Will move the ball on platform, one tube, will move a ball down
- Strategy game
- Real Life Physics
- Platfomrs will progressively get smaller
- Platform must be extremely sensitive
- Platform must be controlled, Ball wil be static
- Two possible items will allow the player to move on
- Three objects will allow the player to move on to the next room
- Once the player gets the right amount of keys, the ball will jump
- The player will control a tilted platorm on a pole, and the platform
- A Vaccuum
- If no movement, the platform falls.
- Every level will increase in:
	- Sensativity
	- Keys
	- Platforms
	- Holes (past the 10'th platform)
- Different Shapes (Circle, Square/Rectangle, Triangle)
- Tilt Mechannism
- Time Trials?
- Score Mechanism

-=Design

- Space-Themed
- Black Hole Theme

-=Gameplay

- Score Mechanics
- Start Button will active tilt mechanic
- Player must keep the ball still, and move it forward
- Tilt Forward moves the ball forward
- If platform is inactive, then the pole strength will decrease with time.
- Calibration (will be set on phone position)
- Tap Option: Will push the platform based on corner (if user taps upper-left, platform will tilt down towards upper-left cormer. if released, platform will be set back to 0)

-=In-App Purcahses

- Different colored balls
